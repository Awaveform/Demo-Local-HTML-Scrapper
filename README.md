# Local-HTML-Scrapper

## **Task**
Manual check of a large number of files according to the checklist.

## **How it works**
The script initializes the collection of key information in the terminal, which saves time on tasks of this type.

## **Description**
This is a demo version that allows you to check its work through the IDE - just put downloaded files (Demo_Local_HTML_Scrapper.py, test_file_1.html, test_file_2.html) in a specific folder, run "Demo_Local_HTML_Scrapper.py" through your IDE and check the result in the terminal.
