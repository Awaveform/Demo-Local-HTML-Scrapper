## **Task:**

## **Description:**
this is a demo version that allows you to check its work through the IDE - just put downloaded files (Demo_Local_HTML_Scrapper.py, test_file_1.html, test_file_2.html) in a specific folder, run "Demo_Local_HTML_Scrapper.py" through IDE, like PyCharm, and check the result in the terminal.
